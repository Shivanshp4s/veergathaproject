            <h3> Short story of "Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon" </h3>
            <h4>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, PVC (17 July 1945 â€“ 14 December 1971) was an officer of
                        the
                        Indian Air Force.
                        He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration during war
                        time, in recognition of his lone defence of Srinagar Air Base against a Pakistan Air Force (PAF)
                        air
                        raid during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
                        He is the only member of the Indian Air Force to be honoured with the PVC.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Sekhon, after being hit, was advised to return to the base by ATC Squadron Leader Virendera
                        Singh Pathania VrC, VM.
                        He is said to have flown in straight, wings level for some time, then going inverted, plummeting
                        down, probably due failure of control system.
                        He attempted a last-minute ejection, which did not prove successful, as his canopy was seen to
                        fly off.
                        The wreckage of the Gnat was found in a gorge, near the road coming from Srinagar town to the
                        base, a few miles from the base.
                        Despite many search efforts by Army and Air Force, his remains were never found due to the
                        mountainous terrain of where his fighter went down, much to the disappointment of his wife and
                        family.
